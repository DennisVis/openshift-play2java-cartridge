# JSON Reads[T]/Writes[T]/Format[T] Combinators

> Please note this documentation was initially published as an article by Pascal Voitot ([@mandubian](http://www.github.com/mandubian)) on [mandubian.com](http://mandubian.com/2012/09/08/unveiling-play-2-dot-1-json-api-part1-jspath-reads-combinators/) 

## Summary of main new features added in <code>Play2.1</code>

- `Reads[T]` / `Writes[T]` / `Format[T]` combinators based on JsPath and simple logic operators

```	
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

val customReads: Reads[(String, Float, List[String])] = 
  (JsPath \ "key1").read[String](email keepAnd minLength(5)) and 
  (JsPath \ "key2").read[Float](min(45)) and
  (JsPath \ "key3").read[List[String]] 
  tupled
```

- `Reads[T]` API now validates JSON by returning a monadic `JsResult[T]` being a `JsSuccess[T]` or a `JsError` aggregating all validation errors 

```
import play.api.libs.json.Json

val js = Json.obj(
  "key1" -> "alpha", 
  "key2" -> 123.345F, 
  "key3" -> Json.arr("alpha", "beta")
)

scala> customReads.reads(js) 
res5: JsSuccess(("alpha", 123.345F, List("alpha", "beta")))

customReads.reads(js).fold(
  invalid = { errors => ... },
  valid = { res => 
    val (s, f, l): (String, Float, List[String]) = res
    ...
  }
)
		
```

**Now let's go in the details ;)**


<br/>
<br/>
# <a name="quick-jspath">JsPath in a nutshell</a>

You certainly know `XMLPath` in which you can access a node of an XML AST using a simple syntax based on path.  
JSON is already an AST and we can apply the same kind of syntax to it and logically we called it `JsPath`.  

All following examples use JSON defined in previous paragraph.

### Building JsPath

```
import play.api.libs.json._

// Simple path
JsPath \ "key1"

// 2-levels path
JsPath \ "key3" \ "key33"
 
// indexed path
(JsPath \ "key3" \ "key32")(2) // 2nd element in a JsArray

// multiple/recursive paths
JsPath \\ "key1"
```

### Alternative syntax

`JsPath` is quite cool but we found this syntax could be made even clearer to highlight `Reads[T]` combinators in the code.  
That's why we provide an alias for `JsPath`: `__` (2 underscores).  
_You can use it or not. This is just a visual facility because with it, you immediately find your JsPath in the code…_

You can write:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

// Simple path
__ \ "key1"

// 2-levels path
__ \ "key3" \ "key33"
 
// indexed path
(__ \ "key3" \ "key32")(2) // 2nd element in a JsArray

// multiple paths
__ \\ "key1"

// a sample on Reads[T] combinators to show the difference with both syntax
// DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS CODE RIGHT NOW… It's explained in next paragraphs
val customReads = 
  (JsPath \ "key1").read(
    (JsPath \ "key11").read[String] and
    (JsPath \ "key11").read[String] and
    (JsPath \ "key11").read[String]
    tupled
  ) and 
  (JsPath \ "key2").read[Float](min(45)) and
  (JsPath \ "key3").read(
    (JsPath \ "key31").read[String] and
    (JsPath \ "key32").read[String] and
    (JsPath \ "key33").read[String]
    tupled
  ) 
  tupled
	
// with __
val customReads = 
  (__ \ "key1").read(
    (__ \ "key11").read[String] and
    (__ \ "key11").read[String] and
    (__ \ "key11").read[String]  
    tupled
  ) and 
  (__ \ "key2").read[Float](min(45)) and
  (__ \ "key3").read[List[String]] (
    (__ \ "key31").read[String] and
    (__ \ "key32").read[String] and
    (__ \ "key33").read[String]
    tupled  
  )
  tupled
	
// You can immediately see the structure of the JSON tree
```


### Accessing value of JsPath

The important function to retrieve the value at a given JsPath in a JsValue is the following:

```
sealed trait PathNode {
  def apply(json: JsValue): List[JsValue]
  …
}
```

As you can see, this function retrieves a `List[JsValue]`

You can simply use it like:

```
import play.api.libs.json._

// build a JsPath
scala> (__ \ "key1")(js) 
res12: List[play.api.libs.json.JsValue] = List("value1")  // actually this is JsString("value1")

// 2-levels path
scala> (__ \ "key3" \ "key33")(js)
res13: List[play.api.libs.json.JsValue] = List({"key":"value2","key34":"value34"})
 
// indexed path
scala> (__ \ "key3" \ "key32")(2)(js)
res14: List[play.api.libs.json.JsValue] = List(234.13)

// multiple paths
scala> (__ \\ "key1")(js)
res17: List[play.api.libs.json.JsValue] = List("value1", "value2")
```

# <a name="reads">Reads[T] is now a validator</a>

## <a name="reads-2_0">Reads in Play2.0.x</a>

Do you remember how you had to write a Json `Reads[T]` in `Play2.0.x` ?  
You had to override the `reads` function.  

```
trait Reads[A] {
  self =>
  /**
   * Convert the JsValue into a A
   */
  def reads(json: JsValue): A
}
```

Take the following simple case class that you want to map on JSON structure:

```
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float
)
```

In `Play2.0.x`, you would write your reader as following:

```
import play.api.libs.json._

implicit val creatureReads = new Reads[Creature] {
  def reads(js: JsValue): Creature = {
    Creature(
      (js \ "name").as[String],
      (js \ "isDead").as[Boolean],
      (js \ "weight").as[Float]
    )
  }
}

scala> val js = Json.obj( "name" -> "gremlins", "isDead" -> false, "weight" -> 1.0F)
scala> val c = js.as[Creature] 
c: Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F)
```

Easy isn't it ?
So what's the problem if it's so easy?

Imagine, you pass the following JSON with a missing field:

```
val js = Json.obj( "name" -> "gremlins", "weight" -> 1.0F)
```

What happens?

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Boolean expected
	at play.api.libs.json.DefaultReads$BooleanReads$.reads(Reads.scala:98)
	at play.api.libs.json.DefaultReads$BooleanReads$.reads(Reads.scala:95)
	at play.api.libs.json.JsValue$class.as(JsValue.scala:56)
	at play.api.libs.json.JsUndefined.as(JsValue.scala:70)
```

**What is this?**
Yes ugly RuntimeException (not even subtyped) but you can work around it using `JsValue.asOpt[T]` :)

```
scala> val c: Option[Creature] = js.asOpt[Creature]
c: None
```

**Cool but you only know that the deserialization `Json => Creature` failed but not where or on which field(s)?**

<br/>
<br/>
## <a name="reads-2_1">Reads in Play2.1</a>
We couldn't keep this imperfect API as is and in `Play2.1`, the `Reads[T]` API has changed into :

```
trait Reads[A] {
  self =>
  /**
   * Convert the JsValue into a A
   */
  def reads(json: JsValue): JsResult[A]
}
```

> Yes you have to refactor all your existing custom Reads but you'll see you'll get lots of new interesting features…

So you remark immediately `JsResult[A]` which is a very simple structure looking a bit like an Either applied to our specific problem.  

**`JsResult[A]` can be of 2 types**:

- **`JsSuccess[A]` when `reads`succeeds**

```
case class JsSuccess[A](
  value: T, // the value retrieved when deserialization JsValue => A worked
  path: JsPath = JsPath() // the root JsPath where this A was read in the JsValue (by default, it's the root of the JsValue)
) extends JsResult[T]

// To create a JsSuccess from a value, simply do:
val success = JsSuccess(Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0))

```

- **`JsError[A]` when `reads` fails**

> Please note the greatest advantage of JsError is that it's a cumulative error which can store several errors discovered in the Json at different JsPath


```
case class JsError(
  errors: Seq[(JsPath, Seq[ValidationError])]  
  // the errors is a sequence of JsPath locating the path 
  // where there was an error in the JsValue and validation 
  // errors for this path
) extends JsResult[Nothing]

// ValidationError is a simple message with arguments (which can be mapped on localized messages)
case class ValidationError(message: String, args: Any*)

// To create a JsError, there are a few helpers and for ex:
val errors1 = JsError( __ \ 'isDead, ValidationError("validate.error.missing", "isDead") )
val errors2 = JsError( __ \ 'name, ValidationError("validate.error.missing", "name") )

// Errors are cumulative which is really interesting
scala> val errors = errors1 ++ errors2
errors: JsError(List((/isDead,List(ValidationError(validate.error.missing,WrappedArray(isDead)))), (/name,List(ValidationError(validate.error.missing,WrappedArray(name))))))
```

So what's interesting there is that `JsResult[A]` is a monadic structure and can be used with classic functions of such structures: 

- `flatMap[X](f: A => JsResult[X]): JsResult[X]`  
- `fold[X](invalid: Seq[(JsPath, Seq[ValidationError])] => X, valid: A => X)`  
- `map[X](f: A => X): JsResult[X]`  
- `filter(p: A => Boolean)`  
- `collect[B](otherwise:ValidationError)(p:PartialFunction[A,B]): JsResult[B]` 
- `get: A`

And some sugar such :

- `asOpt`  
- `asEither`
- … 

>Please note that **`JsResult[A]` is not just Monadic but Applicative** because it cumulates errors.  
>This cumulative feature makes `JsResult[T]` makes it **not very good to be used with _for comprehension_** because you'll get only the first error and not all. 
  
### Reads[A] has become a validator

As you may understand, using the new `Reads[A]`, you don't only deserialize a JsValue into another structure but you really **validate** the JsValue and retrieve all the validation errors.  
BTW, in `JsValue`, a new function called `validate` has appeared:

```
trait JsValue {
…
  def validate[T](implicit _reads: Reads[T]): JsResult[T] = _reads.reads(this)
  
  // same behavior but it throws a specific RuntimeException JsResultException now
  def as[T](implicit fjs: Reads[T]): T
  // exactly the same behavior has before
  def asOpt[T](implicit fjs: Reads[T]): Option[T]
…
}

// You can now write if you got the right implicit in your scope
val res: JsResult[Creature] = js.validate[Creature])
```

<br/>
### Manipulating a JsResult[A]

So when manipulating a `JsResult`, you don't access the value directly and it's preferable to use `map/flatmap/fold` to modify the value.

```
import play.api.libs.json._

val res: JsResult[Creature] = js.validate[Creature]

// managing the success/error and potentially return something
res.fold(
  valid = { c => println( c ); c.name },
  invalid = { e => println( e ); e }
)

// getting the name directly (using the get can throw a NoSuchElementException if it's a JsError)
val name: JsSuccess[String] = res.map( creature => creature.name ).get

// filtering the result
val name: JsSuccess[String] = res.filter( creature => creature.name == "gremlins" ).get

// a classic Play action
def getNameOnly = Action(parse.json) { request =>
  val json = request.body
  json.validate[Creature].fold(
    valid = ( res => Ok(res.name) ),
    invalid = ( e => BadRequest(e.toString) )
  )
}
```

### <a name="play2-syntax">Reads interesting new features</a>

As you know, Json API for Play2.1 was still draft and has evolved since I began writing article part 1/2.  
We have changed a few things since (nothing conceptual, just cosmetics). 


#### `Reads[A <: JsValue] andThen Reads[B]` 
`andThen` has the classic Scala semantic of function composition : it applies `Reads[A <: JsValue]` on JSON retrieving a JsValue and then applies `Reads[B]` on this JsValue.
<br/>

#### `Reads[A <: JsValue].map(f: A => B): Reads[B]` 
`map` is the classic and always very useful Scala map function.
<br/>

#### `Reads[A <: JsValue].flatMap(f: A => Reads[B]): Reads[B]` 
`flatMap` is the classic Scala flatMap function.


### Rewriting the Reads[T] with JsResult[A]

The `Reads[A]` API returning a JsResult, you can't write your `Reads[A]` as before as you must return a JsResult gathering all found errors.  
You could imagine simply compose Reads[T] with flatMap :

**Following code is WRONG**

```
import play.api.libs.json._

// DO NOT USE, WRONG CODE
implicit val creatureReads = new Reads[Creature] {
  def reads(js: JsValue): JsResult[Creature] = {
    (js \ "name").validate[String].flatMap{ name => 
      (js \ "isDead").validate[Boolean].flatMap { isDead =>
	    (js \ "weight").validate[Float].map { weight =>
	      Creature(name, isDead, weight)
	    }
	  }
	}
  }
}
```

>Remember the main purpose of `JsResult` is to gather all found errors while validating the JsValue.

`JsResult.flatMap` is pure monadic function (if you don't know what it is, don't care about it, you can understand without it) implying that the function that you pass to `flatMap()` is called only if the result is a `JsSuccess` else it just returns the `JsError`.  
This means the previous code won't aggregate all errors found during validation and will stop at first error which is exactly what we don't want.

Actually, Monad pattern is not good in our case because we are not just composing Reads but we expect combining them following the schema:

```
Reads[String] AND Reads[Boolean] AND Reads[Float]   
  => Reads[(String, Boolean, Float)]   
     => Reads[Creature]
```

> So we need something else to be able to combine our Reads and this is the greatest new feature that `Play2.1` brings for JSON :  
> **THE READS combinators with JsPath**
<br/>

> If you want more theoretical aspects about the way it was implemented based on generic functional structures adapted to our needs, you can read this post ["Applicatives are too restrictive, breaking Applicatives and introducing Functional Builders"](http://sadache.tumblr.com/post/30955704987/applicatives-are-too-restrictive-breaking-applicativesfrom) written by [@sadache](http://www.github.com/sadache) 


## Writing Reads[T] combinators

### Minimal import to work with combinators

```
// if you need Json structures in your scope
import play.api.libs.json._
// IMPORTANT import this to have the required tools in your scope
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._
```

### Rewriting the Reads[T] with combinators

Go directly to the example as practice is often the best :

```
// IMPORTANT import this to have the required tools in your scope
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

implicit val creatureReads = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float]
)(Creature.apply _)  

// or in a simpler way as case class has a companion object with an apply function
implicit val creatureReads = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float]
)(Creature)  

// or using the operators inspired by Scala parser combinators for those who know them
implicit val creatureReads = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] ~
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] ~
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float]
)(Creature)  

```


So there is nothing quite complicated, isn't it?

####`(__ \ "name")` is the `JsPath` where you gonna apply `read[String]`
<br/>
####`and` is just an operator meaning `Reads[A] and Reads[B] => Builder[Reads[A ~ B]]`
  - `A ~ B` just means `Combine A and B` but it doesn't suppose the way it is combined (can be a tuple, an object, whatever…)   
  - `Builder` is not a real type but I introduce it just to tell that the operator `and` doesn't create directly a `Reads[A ~ B]` but an intermediate structure that is able to build a `Reads[A ~ B]` or to combine with another `Reads[C]`
<br/>

####`(…)(Creature)` builds a `Reads[Creature]`
  - Remark that:
  
```
(__ \ "name").read[String] and (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and (__ \ "weight").read[Float]
```
builds a

```
Builder[Reads[String ~ Boolean ~ Float])]
```

but you expect a `Reads[Creature]`.  
  
  - So you apply the `Builder[Reads[String ~ Boolean ~ String])]` to the function `Creature.apply = (String, Boolean, Float) => Creature` constructor to finally obtain a `Reads[Creature]`

Try it:

```
scala> val js = Json.obj( "name" -> "gremlins", "isDead" -> false, "weight" -> 1.0F)
scala> js.validate[Creature] 
res1: play.api.libs.json.JsResult[Creature] = JsSuccess(Creature(gremlins,false,1.0),) 
// nothing after last comma because the JsPath is ROOT by default

```


Now what happens if you have an error now?

```
scala> val js = Json.obj( "name" -> "gremlins", "weight" -> 1.0F)
scala> js.validate[Creature] 
res2: play.api.libs.json.JsResult[Creature] = JsError(List((/isDead,List(ValidationError(validate.error.missing-path,WrappedArray())))))

```

Explicit, isn't it?

### Complexifying the case

Ok, I see what you think : what about more complex cases where you have several constraints on a field and embedded Json in Json and recursive classes and whatever…

Let's imagine our creature:

- is a relatively modern creature having an email and hating email addresses having less than 5 characters for a reason only known by the creature itself. 
- may have 2 favorites data: 
    - 1 String (called "string" in JSON) which shall not be "ni" (because it loves Monty Python too much to accept this) and then to skip the first 2 chars
    - 1 Int (called "number" in JSON) which can be less than 86 or more than 875 (don't ask why, this is creature with a different logic than ours)
- may have friend creatures
- may have an optional social account because many creatures are not very social so this is quite mandatory

Now the class looks like:

```
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float,
  email: String, // email format and minLength(5)
  favorites: (String, Int), // the stupid favorites
  friends: List[Creature] = Nil, // yes by default it has no friend
  social: Option[String] = None // by default, it's not social
)
```

`Play2.1` provide lots of generic Reads helpers:

- `JsPath.read[A](implicit reads:Reads[A])` can be passed a custom `Reads[A]` which is applied to the JSON content at this JsPath. So with this property, you can compose hierarchically `Reads[T]` which corresponds to JSON tree structure.
- `JsPath.readNullable` allows `Reads[Option[T]]` with missing or empty field
- `Reads.email` which validates the String has email format  
- `Reads.minLength(nb)` validates the minimum length of a String
- `Reads[A] or Reads[A] => Reads[A]` operator is a classic `OR` logic operator
- `Reads[A] keepAnd Reads[B] => Reads[A]` is an operator that tries `Reads[A]` and `Reads[B]` but only keeps the result of `Reads[A]` (For those who know Scala parser combinators `keepAnd == <~` )
- `Reads[A] andKeep Reads[B] => Reads[B]` is an operator that tries `Reads[A]` and `Reads[B]` but only keeps the result of `Reads[B]` (For those who know Scala parser combinators `andKeep == ~>` )

```
// import just Reads helpers in scope
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._
import play.api.data.validation.ValidationError

// defines a custom reads to be reused
// a reads that verifies your value is not equal to a give value
def notEqualReads[T](v: T)(implicit r: Reads[T]): Reads[T] = Reads.filterNot(ValidationError("validate.error.unexpected.value", v))( _ == v )

def skipReads(implicit r: Reads[String]): Reads[String] = r.map( _.substring(2) )

implicit val creatureReads: Reads[Creature] = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float] and
  (__ \ "email").read(email keepAnd minLength[String](5)) and
  (__ \ "favorites").read( 
  	(__ \ "string").read[String]( notEqualReads("ni") andKeep skipReads ) and
  	(__ \ "number").read[Int]( max(86) or min(875) )
  	tupled
  ) and
  (__ \ "friends").lazyRead( list[Creature](creatureReads) ) and
  (__ \ "social").readNullable[String]
)(Creature)  
```

Many things above can be understood very logically but let's explain a bit:

#### `(__ \ "email").read(email keepAnd minLength[String](5))`
- As explained previously, `(__ \ "email").read(…)` applies the `Reads[T]` passed in parameter to function `read` at the given JsPath `(__ \ "email")`
- `email keepAnd minLength[String](5) => Reads[String]` is a Js validator that verifies JsValue:
    1. is a String : `email: Reads[String]` so no need to specify type here
    2. has email format
    3. has min length of 5 (we precise the type here because minLength is a generic `Reads[T]`)  
- Why not `email and minLength[String](5)`? because, as explained previously, it would generate a `Builder[Reads[(String, String)]]` whereas you expect a `Reads[String]`. The `keepAnd` operator (aka `<~`) does what we expect: it validates both sides but if succeeded, it keeps only the result on left side.
<br/>

#### `notEqualReads("ni") andKeep skipReads`

- No need to write `notEqualReads[String]("ni")` because `String` type is inferred from `(__ \ "knight").read[String]` (the power of Scala typing engine)
- `skipReads` is a customReads that skips the first 2 chars
- `andKeep` operator (aka `~>`) is simple to undestand : it validates the left and right side and if both succeeds, only keeps the result on right side. In our case, only the result of `skipReads` is kept and not the result of `notEqualReads`.
<br/>

#### `max(86) or min(875)`

- Nothing to explain there, isn't it ? `or` is the classic `OR`logic operator, nothing else
<br/>

#### `(__ \ "favorites").read(…)`

```
    (__ \ "string").read[String]( notEqualReads("ni") andKeep notEqualReads("swallow") ) and
    (__ \ "number").read[Int]( max(86) or min(875) )
    tupled
```

- Remember that `(__ \ "string").read[String](…) and (__ \ "number").read[Int](…) => Builder[Reads[(String, Int)]]`  
- What means `tupled` ? 
`Builder[Reads[(String, Int)]]` can be used with a case class `apply` function to build the `Reads[Creature]` for ex. But it provides also `tupled` which is quite easy to understand : it _"tuplizes"_ your Builder: `Builder[Reads[(A, B)]].tupled => Reads[(A, B)]` 
- Finally `(__ \ "favorites").read(Reads[(String, Int)]` will validate a `(String, Int)` which is the expected type for field `favorites`
<br/>

#### `(__ \ "friend").lazyRead( list[Creature](creatureReads) )`

This is the most complicated line in this code. But you can understand why: the `friend` field is recursive on the `Creature` class itself so it requires a special treatment.

- `list[Creature](…)` creates a `Reads[List[Creature]]`  
- `list[Creature](creatureReads)` passes explicitly `creatureReads` as an argument because it's recursive and Scala requires that to resolve it. Nothing too complicated…
- `(__ \ "friend").lazyRead[A](r: => Reads[A]))` : `lazyRead` expects a `Reads[A]` value _passed by name_ to allow the type recursive construction. This is the only refinement that you must keep in mind in this very special recursive case.
<br/>

#### `(__ \ "social").readNullable[String]`

Nothing quite complicated to understand: we need to read an option and `readNullable` helps in doing this.

Now we can use this `Reads[Creature]`

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

val gizmojs = Json.obj( 
  "name" -> "gremlins", 
  "isDead" -> false, 
  "weight" -> 1.0F,
  "email" -> "gizmo@midnight.com",
  "favorites" -> Json.obj("string" -> "alpha", "number" -> 85),
  "friends" -> Json.arr(),
  "social" -> "@gizmo"
)

scala> val gizmo = gizmojs.validate[Creature] 
gizmo: play.api.libs.json.JsResult[Creature] = JsSuccess(Creature(gremlins,false,1.0,gizmo@midnight.com,(pha,85),List(),Some(@gizmo)),)

val shaunjs = Json.obj( 
  "name" -> "zombie", 
  "isDead" -> true, 
  "weight" -> 100.0F,
  "email" -> "shaun@dead.com",
  "favorites" -> Json.obj("string" -> "brain", "number" -> 2),
  "friends" -> Json.arr( gizmojs))

scala> val shaun = shaunjs.validate[Creature] 
shaun: play.api.libs.json.JsResult[Creature] = JsSuccess(Creature(zombie,true,100.0,shaun@dead.com,(ain,2),List(Creature(gremlins,false,1.0,gizmo@midnight.com,(alpha,85),List(),Some(@gizmo))),None),)

val errorjs = Json.obj( 
  "name" -> "gremlins", 
  "isDead" -> false, 
  "weight" -> 1.0F,
  "email" -> "rrhh",
  "favorites" -> Json.obj("string" -> "ni", "number" -> 500),
  "friends" -> Json.arr()
)

scala> errorjs.validate[Creature] 
res0: play.api.libs.json.JsResult[Creature] = JsError(List((/favorites/string,List(ValidationError(validate.error.unexpected.value,WrappedArray(ni)))), (/email,List(ValidationError(validate.error.email,WrappedArray()), ValidationError(validate.error.minlength,WrappedArray(5)))), (/favorites/number,List(ValidationError(validate.error.max,WrappedArray(86)), ValidationError(validate.error.min,WrappedArray(875))))))
```

## Reads[A] other features

### `(Reads[A] and Reads[B]).tupled: Reads[(A, B)]` 
This useful to create `Reads[TupleX]`

  (__ \ 'field1).read[String] and 
  (__ \ 'field2).read[Int]
).tupled : Reads[(String, Int)]
```

It also works with JsArray and indexes

```
(
  (__(0)).read[String] and 
  (__(1)).read[Int]
).tupled : Reads[(String, Int)]
```


### `(Reads[A1 <: A] and Reads[A2 <: A]).reduce(implicit reducer: Reducer[A, B]): Reads[B]` 
Useful to read several parts of a JSON and then aggregate them.
This one requires an implicit Reducer/Monoid.
We provide the ones for `JsObject` and `JsArray`.

Here are a few examples using Json transformers presented in next paragraph:

#### **Reduce a JsObject (copies branches and aggregates them in a JsObject)**

```
(
  (__ \ 'field1).json.pickBranch[JsString] and 
  (__ \ 'field2).json.pickBranch[JsNumber]
).reduce : Reads[JsObject]
```

#### **Reduce a JsArray (copies leaf values and aggregates them in a JsArray)**

```
(
  (__ \ 'field1).json.pick[JsString] and 
  (__ \ 'field2).json.pick[JsNumber]
).reduce : Reads[JsArray]
```

# <a name="writes">Writes[T] hasn't changed (except combinators)</a>

## <a name="writes-2_0">Writes in Play2.0.x</a>

Do you remember how you had to write a Json `Writes[T]` in `Play2.0.x` ?  
You had to override the `writes` function.  

```
trait Writes[-A] {
  self =>
  /**
   * Convert the object into a JsValue
   */
  def writes(o: A): JsValue
}
```

Take the same simple case class we used in Part 1:
```
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float
)
```	

In `Play2.0.x`, you would write your `Writes[Creature]` as following (using new Json syntax to re-show it even if it didn't exist in Play2.0.x ;) ):

```
import play.api.libs.json._

implicit val creatureWrites = new Writes[Creature] {
  def writes(c: Creature): JsValue = {
    Json.obj(
    	"name" -> c.name,
    	"isDead" -> c.isDead,
    	"weight" -> c.weight
    )
  }
}

scala> val gizmo = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F)
scala> val gizmojs = Json.toJson(gizmo)
gizmojs: play.api.libs.json.JsValue = {"name":"gremlins","isDead":false,"weight":1.0}

```

## <a name="writes-2_1">Writes in Play2.1.x</a>

No suspense to be kept: **in Play2.1, you write Writes exactly in the same way** :D

So what's the difference?  
As presented in Part 1, `Reads` could be combined using simple logical operators.  
Using functional Scala power, we were able to **provide combinators for `Writes[T]`**.

> If you want more theoretical aspects about the way it was implemented based on generic functional structures adapted to our needs, you can read this post ["Applicatives are too restrictive, breaking Applicatives and introducing Functional Builders"](http://sadache.tumblr.com/post/30955704987/applicatives-are-too-restrictive-breaking-applicativesfrom) written by [@sadache](http://www.github.com/sadache)  

## <a name="writes-combined">Writes main change: *combinators*</a>

Once again, code first: re-writing previous `Writes[T]` using combinators.

```
// IMPORTANT import this to have the required tools in your scope
import play.api.libs.json._
// imports required functional generic structures
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

implicit val creatureWrites = (
  (__ \ "name").write[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").write[Float]
)(unlift(Creature.unapply))

// or using the operators inspired by Scala parser combinators for those who know them
implicit val creatureWrites = (
  (__ \ "name").write[String] ~
  (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] ~
  (__ \ "weight").write[Float]
)(unlift(Creature.unapply))

scala> val c = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F)
scala> val js = Json.toJson(c)
js: play.api.libs.json.JsValue = {"name":"gremlins","isDead":false,"weight":1.0}

```

It looks exactly like `Reads[T]` except a few things, isn't it?  
Let's explain a bit (by copying Reads article changing just a few things… I'm lazy ;)):

####`import play.api.libs.json.Writes._` 
It imports only the required stuff for `Writes[T]` without interfering with other imports.
<br/>

####`(__ \ "name").write[String]`
You apply `write[String]` on this JsPath (exactly the same as `Reads`)
<br/>

####`and` is just an operator meaning `Writes[A] and Writes[B] => Builder[Writes[A ~ B]]`
  - `A ~ B` just means `Combine A and B` but it doesn't suppose the way it is combined (can be a tuple, an object, whatever…)
  - `Builder` is not a real type but I introduce it just to tell that the operator `and` doesn't create directly a `Writes[A ~ B]` but an intermediate structure that is able to build a `Writes[A ~ B]` or to combine with another `Writes[C]`
<br/>
   
####`(…)(unlift(Creature.unapply))` builds a `Writes[Creature]`
  - Remark that:
  
```
(__ \ "name").write[String] and (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] and (__ \ "weight").write[Float]` 
```

builds a 

```
Builder[Writes[String ~ Boolean ~ Float])]` but you want a `Writes[Creature]
```  
  - So you apply the `Builder[Writes[String ~ Boolean ~ String])]` to a function `Creature => (String, Boolean, Float)` to finally obtain a `Writes[Creature]`. Please note that it may seem a bit strange to provide `Creature => (String, Boolean, Float)` to obtain a `Writes[Creature]` from a `Builder[Writes[String ~ Boolean ~ String])]` but it's due to the contravariant nature of `Writes[-T]`.
  - We have `Creature.unapply` but its signature is `Creature => Option[(String, Boolean, Float)]` so we `unlift` it to obtain `Creature => (String, Boolean, Float)`.
<br/>

>The only thing you have to keep in mind is this `unlift` call which might not be natural at first sight!
  
As you can deduce by yourself, the `Writes[T]` is far easier than the `Reads[T]` case because when writing, it doesn't try to validate so there is no error management at all.  

Moreover, due to this, you have to keep in mind that operators provided for `Writes[T]` are not as rich as for `Reads[T]`. Do you remind `keepAnd` and `andKeep` operators?  They don't have any meaning for `Writes[T]`. When writing `A~B`, you write `A and B` but not `only A or only B`. So `and` is the only operators provided for `Writes[T]`.
 

### Complexifying the case

Let's go back to our more complex sample used in end of Part1.
Remember that we had imagined that our creature was modelled as following:

```
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float,
  email: String, // email format and minLength(5)
  favorites: (String, Int), // the stupid favorites
  friends: List[Creature] = Nil, // yes by default it has no friend
  social: Option[String] = None // by default, it's not social
)
```

Let's write corresponding `Writes[Creature]`

```
// IMPORTANT import this to have the required tools in your scope
import play.api.libs.json._
// imports required functional generic structures
import play.api.libs.json.functional.syntax._

implicit val creatureWrites: Writes[Creature] = (
  (__ \ "name").write[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").write[Float] and
  (__ \ "email").write[String] and
  (__ \ "favorites").write( 
  	(__ \ "string").write[String] and
  	(__ \ "number").write[Int]
  	tupled
  ) and
  (__ \ "friends").lazyWrite(Writes.traversableWrites[Creature](creatureWrites)) and
  (__ \ "social").write[Option[String]]
)(unlift(Creature.unapply))  

val gizmo = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F, "gizmo@midnight.com", ("alpha", 85), List(), Some("@gizmo"))
val gizmojs = Json.toJson(gizmo)
gizmojs: play.api.libs.json.JsValue = {"name":"gremlins","isDead":false,"weight":1.0,"email":"gizmo@midnight.com","favorites":{"string":"alpha","number":85},"friends":[],"social":"@gizmo"}

val zombie = Creature("zombie", true, 100.0F, "shaun@dead.com", ("ain", 2), List(gizmo), None)
val zombiejs = Json.toJson(zombie)
zombiejs: play.api.libs.json.JsValue = {"name":"zombie","isDead":true,"weight":100.0,"email":"shaun@dead.com","favorites":{"string":"ain","number":2},"friends":[{"name":"gremlins","isDead":false,"weight":1.0,"email":"gizmo@midnight.com","favorites":{"string":"alpha","number":85},"friends":[],"social":"@gizmo"}],"social":null

```

You can see that it's quite straightforward. it's far easier than `Reads[T]` as there are no special operator.
Here are the few things to explain:

##### `(__ \ "favorites").write(…)`

```
  (__ \ "string").write[String] and
  (__ \ "number").write[Int]
  tupled
```
- Remember that `(__ \ "string").write[String](…) and (__ \ "number").write[Int](…) => Builder[Writes[String ~ Int]]`  
- What means `tupled` ? as for `Reads[T]`, it _"tuplizes"_ your Builder: `Builder[Writes[A ~ B]].tupled => Writes[(A, B)]`

<br/>
##### `(__ \ "friend").lazyWrite(Writes.traversableWrites[Creature](creatureWrites))`

It's the symmetric code for `lazyRead` to treat recursive field on `Creature` class itself:

- `Writes.traversableWrites[Creature](creatureWrites)` creates a `Writes[Traversable[Creature]]` passing the `Writes[Creature]` itself for recursion (please note that a `list[Creature]`should appear very soon ;))
- `(__ \ "friends").lazyWrite[A](r: => Writes[A]))` : `lazyWrite` expects a `Writes[A]` value _passed by name_ to allow the type recursive construction. This is the only refinement that you must keep in mind in this very special recursive case.

> FYI, you may wonder why `Writes.traversableWrites[Creature]: Writes[Traversable[Creature]]` can replace `Writes[List[Creature]]`?  
> This is because `Writes[-T]` is contravariant meaning: if you can write a `Traversable[Creature]`, you can write a `List[Creature]` as `List` inherits `Traversable` (relation of inheritance is reverted by contravariance).

## Writes[A] other features

### `Writes[A].contramap( B => A ): Writes[B]` 

`Writes[A]` is a contravariant functor that can be _contramapped_.
So you must give a function `B => A` to transform into a `Writes[B]`.

For example:

```
scala> case class Person(name: String)
defined class Person

scala> __.write[String].contramap( (p: Person) => p.name )
res5: play.api.libs.json.OWrites[Person] = play.api.libs.json.OWrites$$anon$2@61df9fa8
```

### `(Writes[A] and Writes[B]).tupled: Writes[(A, B)]` 
This useful to create `Writes[TupleX]`

```
(
  (__ \ 'field1).write[String] and 
  (__ \ 'field2).write[Int]
).tupled : Writes[(String, Int)]
```

**Known limitation** please note that the following doesn't work: it compiles but it will break at runtime as Writes combinators only know how to generate JsObject but not JsArray.

```
// BE CAREFUL: IT COMPILES BUT BREAKS AT RUNTIME
(
  (__(0)).write[String] and 
  (__(1)).write[Int]
).tupled : Writes[(String, Int)]
```


### `(Writes[A1 <: A] and Writes[A2 <: A]).join: Writes[A]` 
Useful to write the same value in several branches.

For example:

```
// Please note you must give the type of resulting Writes
scala> val jsWrites: Writes[JsString] = (
     |   (__ \ 'field1).write[JsString] and 
     |   (__ \ 'field2).write[JsString]
     | ).join
jsWrites: play.api.libs.json.Writes[play.api.libs.json.JsString] = play.api.libs.json.OWrites$$anon$2@732db69a

scala> jsWrites.writes(JsString("toto"))
res3: play.api.libs.json.JsObject = {"field1":"toto","field2":"toto"}
```


## <a name="format">What about combinators for Format?</a>

Remember in Play2.1, there was a feature called `Format[T] extends Reads[T] with Writes[T]`.  
It mixed `Reads[T]` and `Writes[T]` together to provide serialization/deserialization at the same place.

Play2.1 provide combinators for `Reads[T]` and `Writes[T]`. What about combinators for `Format[T]` ?

Let's go back to our very simple sample:

```
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float
)
```

Here is how you write the `Reads[Creature]`:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

val creatureReads = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float]
)(Creature)  
```

>Please remark that I didn't use `implicit` so that there is no implicit `Reads[Creature]` in the context when I'll define `Format[T]`

Here is how you write the `Writes[Creature]`:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

val creatureWrites = (
  (__ \ "name").write[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").write[Float]
)(unlift(Creature.unapply))  
```

###How to gather both Reads/Writes to create a `Format[Creature]`?

#### <a name="format-1">1st way = create from existing reads/writes</a>

You can reuse existing `Reads[T]` and `Writes[T]` to create a `Format[T]` as following:

```
implicit val creatureFormat = Format(creatureReads, creatureWrites)

val gizmojs = Json.obj( 
  "name" -> "gremlins", 
  "isDead" -> false, 
  "weight" -> 1.0F
)

val gizmo = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F)

assert(Json.fromJson[Creature](gizmojs).get == gizmo)
assert(Json.toJson(gizmo) == gizmojs)

```

#### <a name="format-2">2nd way = create using combinators</a>

We have Reads and Writes combinators, isn't it?  
Play2.1 also provides **Format Combinators** due to the magic of functional programming (actually it's not magic, it's just pure functional programming;) )

As usual, code 1st:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

implicit val creatureFormat = (
  (__ \ "name").format[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").format[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").format[Float]
)(Creature.apply, unlift(Creature.unapply))  

val gizmojs = Json.obj( 
  "name" -> "gremlins", 
  "isDead" -> false, 
  "weight" -> 1.0F
)

val gizmo = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F)

assert(Json.fromJson[Creature](gizmojs).get == gizmo)
assert(Json.toJson(gizmo) == gizmojs)
```

Nothing too strange…

#####`(__ \ "name").format[String]`
It creates a format[String] reading/writing at the given `JsPath`
<br/>

#####`( )(Creature.apply, unlift(Creature.unapply))`
To map to a Scala structure:

- `Reads[Creature]` requires a function `(String, Boolean, Float) => Creature`
- `Writes[Creature]` requires a function `Creature => (String, Boolean, Float)`

So as `Format[Creature] extends Reads[Creature] with Writes[Creature]` we provide `Creature.apply` and `unlift(Creature.unapply)` and that's all folks...

## <a name="format">More complex case</a>

The previous sample is a bit dumb because the structure is really simple and because reading/writing is symmetric. We have:

```
Json.fromJson[Creature](Json.toJson(creature)) == creature
```

In this case, you read what you write and vis versa. So you can use the very simple `JsPath.format[T]` functions which build both `Reads[T]` and `Writes[T]` together.  

But if we take our usual more complicated case class, how to write the `Format[T]`?

Remind the code:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

// The case class
case class Creature(
  name: String, 
  isDead: Boolean, 
  weight: Float,
  email: String, // email format and minLength(5)
  favorites: (String, Int), // the stupid favorites
  friends: List[Creature] = Nil, // yes by default it has no friend
  social: Option[String] = None // by default, it's not social
)

import play.api.data.validation.ValidationError
import play.api.libs.json.Reads._

// defines a custom reads to be reused
// a reads that verifies your value is not equal to a give value
def notEqualReads[T](v: T)(implicit r: Reads[T]): Reads[T] = Reads.filterNot(ValidationError("validate.error.unexpected.value", v))( _ == v )

def skipReads(implicit r: Reads[String]): Reads[String] = r.map( _.substring(2) )

val creatureReads: Reads[Creature] = (
  (__ \ "name").read[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").read[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").read[Float] and
  (__ \ "email").read(email keepAnd minLength[String](5)) and
  (__ \ "favorites").read( 
  	(__ \ "string").read[String]( notEqualReads("ni") andKeep skipReads ) and
  	(__ \ "number").read[Int]( max(86) or min(875) )
  	tupled
  ) and
  (__ \ "friends").lazyRead( list[Creature](creatureReads) ) and
  (__ \ "social").read(optional[String])
)(Creature)  

import play.api.libs.json.Writes._

val creatureWrites: Writes[Creature] = (
  (__ \ "name").write[String] and
  (__ \ "isDead").write[Boolean] and
  (__ \ "weight").write[Float] and
  (__ \ "email").write[String] and
  (__ \ "favorites").write( 
  	(__ \ "string").write[String] and
  	(__ \ "number").write[Int]
  	tupled
  ) and
  (__ \ "friends").lazyWrite(Writes.traversableWrites[Creature](creatureWrites)) and
  (__ \ "social").write[Option[String]]
)(unlift(Creature.unapply))

```

As you can see, `creatureReads` and `creatureWrites` are not exactly symmetric and couldn't be merged in one single `Format[Creature]` as done previously.

```
Json.fromJson[Creature](Json.toJson(creature)) != creature
```

Hopefully, as done previously, we can build a `Format[T]` from a `Reads[T]` and a `Writes[T]`.

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

implicit val creatureFormat: Format[Creature] = Format(creatureReads, creatureWrites)

// Testing Serialization of Creature to Json
val gizmo = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F, "gizmo@midnight.com", ("alpha", 85), List(), Some("@gizmo"))
val zombie = Creature("zombie", true, 100.0F, "shaun@dead.com", ("ain", 2), List(gizmo), None)

val zombiejs = Json.obj(
	"name" -> "zombie",
	"isDead" -> true,
	"weight" -> 100.0,
	"email" -> "shaun@dead.com",
	"favorites" -> Json.obj(
		"string" -> "ain",
		"number" -> 2
	),
	"friends" -> Json.arr(
		Json.obj(
			"name" -> "gremlins",
			"isDead" -> false,
			"weight" -> 1.0,
			"email" -> "gizmo@midnight.com",
			"favorites" -> Json.obj(
				"string" -> "alpha",
				"number" -> 85
			),
			"friends" -> Json.arr(),
			"social" -> "@gizmo"
		)
	),
	"social" -> JsNull
)

assert(Json.toJson(zombie) == zombiejs)

// Testing Deserialization of JSON to Creature (note the dissymetric reading)
val gizmo2 = Creature("gremlins", false, 1.0F, "gizmo@midnight.com", ("pha", 85), List(), Some("@gizmo"))
val zombie2 = Creature("zombie", true, 100.0F, "shaun@dead.com", ("n", 2), List(gizmo2), None)

assert(Json.fromJson[Creature](zombiejs).get == zombie2)

```

## Format[A] other features

### `Format[A].inmap( A => B, B => A ): Format[B]` 

`Format[A]` is both covariant and contravariant (invariant) functor.
So you must give both functions `A => B` and `B => A` to transform into a `Format[B]`.

For example:

```
scala> case class Person(name: String)
defined class Person

scala> __.format[String].inmap( (name: String) => Person(name), (p: Person) => p.name )
res6: play.api.libs.json.OFormat[Person] = play.api.libs.json.OFormat$$anon$1@2dc083c1
```
